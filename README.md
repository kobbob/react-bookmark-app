# üåê bookmark.world üåê
*A simple bookmark manager to store website links in your browser.*


## ‚¶ø App Brief
* Develop a JavaScript web app that stores a list of bookmarks (links). 
* Use front-end technologies only (HTML, CSS, JavaScript or React) (see [Limitations](#limitations) below for how the app could be improved). 
* Practice Web CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and using localStorage to maintain data on browser refresh. 

### Requirements:

### ‚ñπ App

* Display a form at the top of the page for the user to submit a link. 
* Form validation should highlight if the URL is invalid/ doesn't exist. 
* Display the list of links with pagination (20 per page). 
* Format pagination with numbers and next/previous values e.g. < 1 2 3 >
* Users should be able to remove links and clear all. 

### ‚ñπ Documentation
* Comment all code. 
* Include a brief TDD (Technical Design Document) showing the solution's design & any limitations. 
* Demonstrate good tooling setup e.g. linting, webpack setup etc. 

## ‚ú® Bonus Features
* Toggle Button: List and Grid (thumbnail image) View.
* Show total number of links. 
* Search bar. 
* Categorising with tags. 
* Building collection folders to organise links. 
* Engaging landing page (TBC if necessary). 
* Modal popup dialogues with instructions on how to use the app (to then be hidden on browser reload). 
* Colour theme picker for user to change (light, dark, certain colours). 
* Filter & sort function.
