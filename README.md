# üåê bookmark.world üåê
*A simple bookmark manager to store website links in your browser.*


## ‚¶ø App Brief
* Develop a JavaScript web app that stores a list of bookmarks (links). 
* Use front-end technologies only (HTML, CSS, JavaScript or React) (see [Limitations](#limitations) below for how the app could be improved). 
* Practice Web CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and using localStorage to maintain data on browser refresh.
